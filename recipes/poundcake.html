            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>"This is the recipe my Grandmother would make every year during the holidays. I found the recipe tucked in her Bible when she passed, and it was written in her Grandmother's handwriting. It's been in my family for at least 7 generations, and in 2012, I won a Blue Ribbon at the Kentucky State fair by following her exact instructions. Tastes like pure love!"
